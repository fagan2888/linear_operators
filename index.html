    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>
    linear_operators is a package implementing estimation algorithms
    for large scale linear inverse problems. This class of problem
    includes deconvolution or tomography for instance.
    </p>

    <h2> Workflow </h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
	<li> generate a linear model using LinearOperator instances as
	  buildling blocks, </li>

	<li> define a criterion to minimize using this model
	  (e.g. least-square), </li>

	<li>finally, perform minimization on the criterion using a
	  minimization algorithm (e.g. conjugate gradient).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2> Design </h2>
    <p>
      In its most simple form, linear inverse estimation simply
      consists in find the variable x knowing the equation \( y = A x
      \), the data y and the linear model (or matrix) \( A \). As
      large scale problems can scale to millions of data element and
      unknowns, inverting the matrix \( A \) or even storing it is
      impossible. Fortunately, \( x \) can be found with algorithms
      which require only to perform the matrix vector operations \( A
      x \) and \( A^T y \). The LinearOperator object is an object
      which stores precisely those operations and mimics the behavior
      of a standard matrix to a given extent. For instance, it is
      possible to add or multiply LinearOperators.
    </p>

    <p>
      It can be shown that inverting the equation \( y = A x \) can be
      done by minimizing the cost function \( \| y - Ax \|^2 \) with
      respect to \( x \) (this is
      instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">the
      method of least squares</a>. Using LinearOperators it is
      possible to define cost functions (also called criterions) whose
      minimum correspond to a least squares solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      These criterions can then be passed to minimization algorithms
      which handle functions as arguments, as do the optimizers
      provided by the scipy.optimize package.
    </p>

    <p> The linear_operators package provide a set of standard
    LinearOperators subclasses such as convolution, Fourier transform,
    wavelets, ... It also provides a set of minimization algorithms
    and bindings to scipy.optimize optimizer and also
    scikits.optimization.

    <h2> Subpackages </h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
	<li>interface : Taken from the scipy.sparse package. It
	  implement the LinearOperator class which replaces matrices
	  and do not require to store any matrix coefficient. It makes
	  use of matrix-vector operations instead. </li>

	<li>operators : A set of LinearOperator subclasses
	  implementing various linear operation on vectors and their
	  transpose. </li>

	<li>ndoperators : A set of LinarOperator subclasses
	  implementing operations on multidimensional arrays. </li>

	<li>iterative : Contains the Criterion class which allows to
	  define objective function as well as minimizers such as the
	  conjugate gradient algorithms and wrappers to other
	  minimizing algorithms. </li>

	<li>wrappers : define extra LinearOperator subclasses if
      optional dependencies are available. </li>

      </ul>
