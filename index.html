    <p>linear_operators is a package implementing estimation
      algorithms for large scale linear problems. The workflow is as
      follows :

      <ul>
	<li> generate a linear model using LinearOperator instances as
	  buildling blocks, </li>

	<li> define a criterion to minimize using this model
	  (e.g. least-square), </li>

	<li>finally, perform minimization on the criterion using a
	  minimization algorithm (e.g. conjugate gradient).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Subpackages implements each part of this workflow. Here is a
      list of the subpackages :

      <ul>
	<li>interface : Taken from the scipy.sparse package. It
	  implement the LinearOperator class which replaces matrices
	  and do not require to store any matrix coefficient. It makes
	  use of matrix-vector operations instead. </li>

	<li>operators : A set of LinearOperator subclasses
	  implementing various linear operation on vectors and their
	  transpose. </li>

	<li>ndoperators : A set of LinarOperator subclasses
	  implementing operations on multidimensional arrays. </li>

	<li>iterative : Contains the Criterion class which allows to
	  define objective function as well as minimizers such as the
	  conjugate gradient algorithms and wrappers to other
	  minimizing algorithms. </li>

	<li>wrappers : define extra LinearOperator subclasses if
      optional dependencies are available. </li>

      </ul>
